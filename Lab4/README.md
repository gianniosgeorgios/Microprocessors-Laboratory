### Lab 4: Combining sensory data from temperature sources


![71-gFUwqUlL _SX425_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50829499/112127715-65a88980-8bce-11eb-9fc1-752d0f712c7f.jpg)


#### 1. Display environment's temperature on LEDS

Taking temperature from  `DS1820` sensor and displaying it to  `PORB` leds. The resolution (he minimum change in input that can be sensed) is about 0.5 째C.Note that 8  `MSB` 
correspond to sign value (sign extention), and 8  `LSB` to temperature's value (as 2nd complement). In case that sensor does not exists, MSB Led is turned ON.
Examples:

* Example 1: 
 ```
 0x0032 = 25 째C
 ```
* Example 2:
 ```
 0xFFFF = - 0.5 째C
 ```
 * Example 3:
 ```
 0xFF92 = - 55 째C
 ```
  * Example 4:
 ```
 0x8000 = NO DEVICE
 ```
#### 2. Display environment's temperature on LCD screen 

The same process but input from keypad and output on LCD screen.
